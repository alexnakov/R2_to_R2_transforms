# R2_to_R2_transforms

This is a html webpage which visualises linear and non-linear 2D-transformations

The main components of the page are:
- 2 canvases to show the before and after vectors space
- Latex to easily illustrate what transformation is chosen.

TODO:
 - Create the original canvas grid, don't worry about it being reactive right now.
