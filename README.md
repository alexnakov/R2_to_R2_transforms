# R2_to_R2_transforms

This is a html webpage which visualises linear 2D-transformations

The main components of the page are:
- An SVG viewport showing the straight lines of the standart 2D plane.
- Using CSS to display matrix formula for the linear transform.
- Using Inputs and MathML is difficult as there is a need to interact with 2 different namespaces.
